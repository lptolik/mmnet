Description: This package gives the implementations microbiome metabolic network constructing and analyzing.
             It introduces a unique metagenomic systems biology approach,  mapping metagenomic data to the
             KEGG global metabolic pathway and constructing a systems-level network. The system-level network
             and the next topological analysis will be of great help to analysis the various functional
             properties, including regulation and metabolic functionality of the metagenome.
