Description: This package gives the implementations microbiome
        metabolic network constructing and analyzing. It introduces a
        unique metagenomic systems biology approach, mapping
        metagenomic data to the KEGG global metabolic pathway and
        constructing a systems-level network. The system-level network
        and the next topological analysis will be of great help to
        analysis the various functional properties, including
        regulation and metabolic functionality of the metagenome.
